    "The traditional method to deal with chemical structure searching on databases is to use a database extension (called a 'cartridge'), which extends the database SQL syntax to provide additional functions for chemistry-specific tasks like property computation and structure matching. The Cactvs toolkit supports this mechanismn, too - see the Jupyter tutorial on setting up a MySQL structure database.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with databases ever increasing in size, this apporach has met a problem. Maintaing huge databases in-house is a problem, and the solution is to move into the cloud. There are a significant number of hosters, like Amazon or Google, which offer effectively unlimited database storage size for quite reasonable fees, while supporting access to the database contents by standard SQL, thus making the transition not too difficult for normal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But chemistry data poses a problem. None of the hosters allow the loading of cartridges, which are generally supplied as compiled native binary code in the form of shared libraries or DLLs, into their database engines. This is understandable - untrusted, unchecked code can wreck havoc on the cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So is there another way to provide the classical chemical structure and reaction searches which bypasses the cartridge problem? \n",
    "\n",
    "There may be. SQL is quite powerful, and has evolved over the years. The theoretical feasibility of substructure matching in pure SQL has already been demonstrated over a decode ago, though in a fashion which, due to the combinatorial power laws implicit in the chosen implementation, are clearly impractical for databases of practical size. But this can be improved upon, as we will see.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will set up a PostgreSQL structure database with the the usual tutorial Emolecules data, and augment it by three very basic standard tables encoding structure-level, atom and bond attributes or connectivity. We will then demonstrate how to query such a structure database from the toolkit without resorting to cartridge technology or client-side processing after downloading structure data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanisms used to realize pure SQL structure queries are designed to be compatible both with AWS Aurora and Google BigQuery, covering the two biggest players, but should work on other database system with support for reasonably up-to-date SQL support."

However, our sample query still works - if you have installed the PostgreSQL Cactvs chemistry cartridge for the _emolecules_ database. The cartridge does add that functionality as an auxiliary function. This of course, in strict terms, defeats the very purpose of our exercise - but it is just a tutorial.\n",

So even if you are already using the cartridge for other databases, you still need to run the init statements for the _emolecules_ database."

We could significantly improve on the original idea, by dynamically encoding a query-specific bredth-first step-by-step match algorithm in computer-generated SQL."

    "It however follows the standard substructure match process: First sieve promising structures by requiring that all bits in a fragment bitvector computed on the query structure are also set on the corresponding bitvector in the database structure, followed by an atom-by-atom match procedure. The latter is the part after the bitvector test and computer-generated anew for each specific query, just like the screening part. In contrast to a simplistic approach which uses _select_ to retrieve any combination of atoms from a structure record and then checks whether this subset matches the substructure (which suffers from intolerable combinatorial explosion), this algorithm adds a single additional atom (starting with the most exotic atom in the substructure) which can be connected via a bond to the existing partial substructure matches contained in an evolving temporary table set (one table per match level) in a stepwise fashion. Ring closure bonds and multi-fragment substructures are handled by extra injected code components.\n",

With the exception of the _bit_count()_ issue discussed before, this is all present in PostgreSQL, and also in AWS Aurora or Google BigQuery.\n",

Important gaps are the support for matching atom and bond stereochemistry in substructure search, as well as support for hierarchical substructure constructs, like Recursive SMARTS. Reaction matching is also completely absent. Be warned, currently there is no indication if you use an unsupported feature. Rather, the query will execute with abbreviated query conditions."
