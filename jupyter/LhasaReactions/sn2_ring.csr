	SUBROUTINE SN2_RING
...++
... SN2_RING checks for acceptable ring sizes for intramolecular Sn2
... displacements.  The subroutine is called with the bond broken by
... the transform as the sole calling argument.  SN2_RING cannot kill
... the calling transform, so no success check need be made.

... The subroutine is called by SN2_3RING.
