	SUBROUTINE SN2_POSTMECH
...++
... SN2_POSTMECH does post-mechanism qualifiers for Sn2 displacements.
... For transforms in which a ring cannot be broken, the postmech qualifiers
... can be processed as target qualifiers, ie call SN2_postmech early in the
... transform to avoid unnecessary processing.
... The routine is called with a single calling argument, the center
... being attacked in the Sn2 displacement.  SN2_POSTMECH is capable
... of killing the calling transform, so a success check must be made
... on return.
