	SUBROUTINE SN2_PRIME
...++
... SN2_PRIME checks for the possibility of intermolecular SN2' attack
... in the case of an allylic or doubly-allylic SN2 center.  The
... subroutine should be called in the mechanism section of a transform.
... The subroutine can modify the rating, but cannot kill the calling
... transform, so no success test need be done on return.
...
... Calling arguments are the (allylic) center being attacked and the
... attacking atom (absent in the case of hydride attack), in that order.
... Uses SAVED*ATOM 1 and 2 and SAVED*BOND 1 internally.
...--
... Note that if the allylic substate is symmetrical,
... e.g., allylbromide, nothing is subtracted for SN2' attack.

... Actually, if there is more than one SN2' attack possible, the
... various possible attacks (SN2 and SN2') can hardly be equivalent.

...
... Decrement the rating unless the allylic system is symmetrical.
... To perceive such symmetry, we would like to generate a temporary
... allylic "triradical" (C'-C'-C').  However, disconnecting the
... molecule will cause the PERFORM to kill the transform.  Why,
... I don't know.  So we reconnect SPECIFIED*ATOM 2 to the central
... atom of the allylic system (in order to not disrupt any symmetry).
