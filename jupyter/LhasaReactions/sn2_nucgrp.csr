	SUBROUTINE SN2_NUCGRP
...++
... SN2_NUCGRP looks at the attacking nucleophile in an Sn2 displacement
... to determine the basisity vs nucleophilicity of the nucleophile.
... Nucleophiles are divided into three groups and flags are set to make the
... information available from other subroutines (i.e. SN2_CENTER)
...
... Hard basic nucleophiles make up one group, soft weak bases make up another,
... and the rest fall into a main category in between.
...
... Calling arguments are the attacking atom and the center being attacked.
