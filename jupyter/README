This directory contains (or can contain) Jupyter notebooks which demonstrate capabilities of the toolkit with the Python scripting interface.

The data for this section is platform-independent. Since it also contains a substantial queryable structure database, its size is pretty hefty
and it is therefore distributed as a separate package.

The notebooks and associated sample data can be freely downloaded from

https://www.xemistry.com/academic/cactvstools-jupyter-notebooks-$(VERSION).tar.gz.

The standard installer script also offers an option to fetch the package as part of the normal installation routine.

The Jupyter server bundled with Cactvs can be started as 'csjp notebook'. It is recommended you have an open Web browser ready
before running the command, so that the Jupyter start page is automatically displayed.

Instructions on how to connect to the notebook server with explicit commands, or from a remote site,
are displayed in the csjp command output. The connection command includes a security token, so this is a different
command for every new server instance.

If you do not want to use the bundled Jupyter server, you can also load Cactvs into any standard Jupyter server. 
The Python statements to do this properly can be found pre-configured in howto/cactvs.py. The standard toolkit installation
script will also ask you to whether you want to set up an init file for auto-loading Cactvs into any Jupyter
server using these statements.
